This is a fast-paced and honors-level course which delves deep into advanced algebraic concepts, requiring students to have gained a strong background knowledge in a previous Algebra 1 course. Algebra 2 with Trigonometry provides a comprehensive exploration of functions, polynomials, rational exponents and radicals, logarithms, rational expressions and equations, sequences and series, statistics, and trigonometry. Students will expand their understanding of mathematical concepts and how they are connected as well as improve logical thinking and problem solving skills. Additionally, students will focus on the deeper meaning of mathematical concepts such as the reasons why certain “rules” or theorems exist and how functions behave. Algebra 2 strengthens students’ algebraic abilities and problem solving skills, lending itself to the study of trigonometry which is a true coupling of advanced algebraic concepts and geometric properties. In general, Algebra 2 with Trigonometry is a rigorous mathematics course in which students develop skills such as making connections between various concepts, problem solving using multiple methods and representations, critical thinking, efficiency, and developing a coherent, logical argument.",
